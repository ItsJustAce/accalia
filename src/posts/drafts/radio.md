## Radio Free Europe, and uh the rest of the globe i guess
We all sorta let the algorithm guide our music experience (or a certain fucking music rating site) in the modern day and I kinda hate it? Unconventionally, I tried out the radio for the first time in what feels like forever. It seems like a bygone relic like the Compackt Diskc and the ye olde taype but its still kicking about. i dont know another person who still listens to the radio.<br>
i think my first reminder of the radio waves that are being thrown through my skull was hearing rock n roll legend iggy pop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop shoutout the likes of underscores and 100 gecs on his slot on the UK's BBC Radio 6 <br>i think theres something to listening to music curated and chosen by another person. in the way that we use playlists as discovery, i think thats what radio is for. each host has their own personal style they bring to the table, and i love hearing each persons opinions and feelings on the music they chose for their slot. one of my favs is craig charles, he usually has an afternoon or evening slot i believe. but he always picks bangers. plus, they have an artist in residence usually. this is a band/artist who hosts an evening for a little while. there has been the likes of big thief, pinkpantheress etc. who commentate, add their experiences and provide context to the music they choose. and this is true of the whole thing! i think many of the popular stations get heavily commercialised and end up being generalised for as wide an audience as possible and you lose that personal connection you can have with the community the station fosters. ive listened to interviews with artists while they play their music, and i love it. one afternoon they played the entirety of in the court of the crimson king (track) including the instrumental sections. plus, impossible soul by sufjan stevens in its entirety. this is why its so special to me.<br>
whilst you can opt for spotify generated playlists or that fucking ai dj that made me very upset at its release why bother? there are people out there who love music and talk about it too.
